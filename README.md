# Rainmeter-WallpaperTimeWalker
A simple Rainmeter code which changes a given picture depending on the hour of day


### Configuration
Open and configure the ``.\wallpaper.ini`` for your disired pictures, and optionally change which hours of the day the given picture is shown.
You can show the same picutre multiple times per day. 
You may want to change the given height of the image, see instructions in the .ini file

In the included ``.\BG`` folder there are a black and a biege background meant for putting behind your pictures if necasarry. Beige is for easier tracking in the event of a black background. 



### Example
These changes towards night in my case:
