# Rainmeter-WallpaperTimeWalker
A simple Rainmeter code which changes a given picture depending on the hour of day


Open and configure the ``.\wallpaper.ini`` for your disired pictures, and optionally change which hours of the day the given picture is shown.
You can show the same picutre multiple times per day.

In the included ``.\BG`` folder there are a black and a biege background meant for putting behind your pictures if necasarry. Beige is for easier tracking in the event of a black background. 

Example:
(Note followng:
- following iamges are for personal use
- I do not have royalty to the original image
-  following images are modified and does not fully resemble original image)

These changes towards night in my case:
